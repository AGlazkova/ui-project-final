                </div>
                <p>The car-free Friedrichstraße project was launched under the title of <span class="hashtag">#Friedrichisnice</span> by the district office Mitte, the Senate Department for Environment, Transport and Climate Protection as well as the Senate Department for Economy, Energy and Enterprises. The Potsdam-based IASS (Institute for Transformative Sustainability Research) was commissioned to measure the air data in Friedrichstraße and the parallel side streets.
                    A new type of sensor from Earthsense was installed in Friedrichstraße and in the parallel streets Charlottenstraße and Glinkastraße to collect hourly values.</p>
                
                
    
                <p>Unlike the instruments traditionally used to measure air pollution, this new technology is still under development. As a result, the measurements are associated with a somewhat higher degree of uncertainty.</p> 
                <p>
                However, there are some key advantages to data collection:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>high temporal resolution </li>
                    <li>detection of a wide range of pollutants</li>
                    <li>price advantage (compared to traditional instrumentation)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The data from the side streets have been collected as comparative values. Dr. Erika von Schneidemesser from the IASS Potsdam observes: "Friedrichstraße and the two parallel streets Charlottenstraße and Glinkastraße had a considerable amount of local traffic before the implementation of the measure. The open question was whether, after the implementation of the Friedrichstraße promenade, the parallel streets would end up with higher levels of air pollution due to alternate traffic. We measured the pollutant load and are happy to provide our preliminary data to this project already. However, it is still too early for a scientifically sound classification and interpretation. Our preliminary analysis (of data through the end of November) shows that after Friedrichstrasse was closed to motor vehicle traffic, air pollutant levels on Friedrichstrasse declined somewhat and are now similar to levels at an inner-city background location. In contrast, air pollution levels in the side streets remain higher than urban background levels on weekdays, but have decreased to urban background levels on weekends. However, any increase in side street air pollution concentrations at this time is minimal."</p>

            <div class="column">
                <p>On the question of the effect of the closure on air quality, further analysis by the IASS is planned as soon as more data are available. However, there are some uncertainties:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>the pandemic and resulting closures</li>
                    <li>a construction site in Glinkastraße</li>
                    <li>no data during maintenance for approx. 1-2 weeks each (end of September, July, November 2020)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The air quality data presented here is preliminary and subject to change.</p>

                <p>These graphs can be used to show the variations in average NO<sub>2</sub>-Concentration in the three streets over the months. Possible reasons for this are the meteorological circumstances as well as the imponderables already mentioned. </p>
                <p>
                Nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>) is produced as a by-product of the combustion of fossil fuels, such as gas, coal and oil, and is therefore also a component of exhaust gases from motor vehicles and aircraft.</p>
                <p>
                    The limit value of nitrogen content recommended by the Federal Environment Agency is 40 μg/m³. To protect vegetation, a critical value of 30 µg/m³ NO<sub>2</sub> used as the annual mean value.</p>
                <p>With regard to health risks, the Federal Environment Agency comments as follows: "Nitrogen dioxide concentrations occurring in the environment are a particular problem for asthmatics, as bronchial constriction (bronchial narrowing) can develop, which can be exacerbated by the effects of allergens, for example."

                <h1 class="header">Discourse on Twitter</h1>
                <p>Twitter as a social media platform offers the possibility to access an extensive collection of posts, which can be selected according to topic or time period.
                    The closure of Friedrichstraße also resulted in numerous statements on Twitter. These became the supplementary data set for the visualization.</p>
    
                <p>First of all, the data collection should be done with the API (programming interface) integrated by Twitter. However, this only gives access to tweets that are not older than one week. This meant that not all tweets for the period relevant to the project could be collected.</p>
    
                <p>The second attempt was made with a pipeline based on the Python programming language. This method, also known as "scrapping", made it possible to collect the Twitter posts for the entire period.
                </p>
                <p>
                Data selection was based on hashtags entered by users, for example: <span class="hashtag">#friedrichstraße</span>, <span class="hashtag">#autofrei</span> oder auch <span class="hashtag">#flaniermeile</span>. Thus, it was possible to determine that the tweets were directly related to the topic in terms of content. </p>
                <p>
                The project-related hashtag #friedrichsnice was deliberately omitted because of its positive charge.
                Furthermore, the geo-position of Friedrichstraße was entered as a filter factor.</p>
                <p>
                Twitter data were collected from July 1 to November 30, 2020.
                For the sake of contextuality, the number of tweets displayed was limited to a maximum of five per day. If more than five posts were posted for a date, a random selection was made.</p>
                <p>
                    The closure of Friedrichstraße has caused a lot of discussion in the German-language Twitter segment. The politically charged nature of the topic is particularly striking: Not only major media outlets such as the Berliner Morgenpost and TAZ have commented on the project, but also local politicians.</p>

                <p>The project was created as part of the Human-Machine Interface course. For the project, the IASS Potsdam air data was used.

                <p>
                The month-long exchange of views on the Friedrichstrasse closure was not only verbal, but also digital on Twitter. In this, there was an opportunity to connect quantitative aerial data with qualitative Twitter data.

                    The Twitter posts referred almost exclusively to Friedrichstraße, so the side streets were relegated to the background in terms of content.

                <p>
                    The intention behind the visualization is not to clearly evaluate the data, but to provide users with a basis for forming their own opinions. </p>
